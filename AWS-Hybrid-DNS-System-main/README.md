This was a project I completed where I established hybrid network connectivity and DNS integration between AWS and on-premises servers which redirected queries/traffic from the on-premise DNS servers to AWS. 

I utilized a VPC peering connection between the on-premises environment and AWS to simulate a Direct Connect connection. Created a private hosted zone in Route53 in AWS and configured inbound and outbound endpoints.

Edited configuration files for the on-premise DNS servers and specified the private IP addresses of the AWS Route53 inbound endpoints to facilitate integration.I then edited DNS configuration files for the on-premises application server and added the private IP addresses of the DNS servers. This allowed the on-premises application server to use the DNS servers.

The end state architecture looked like this:

To accomplish this (further detail):

In the first stage, I had to establish hybrid network connectivity. I accomplished this by creating a VPC Peering connection, which was used to simulate a AWS Direct Connect between the AWS and on-premises environment.  This was done so by configuring the route tables for the AWS VPC and then adding the route for the CIDR range of the on-premises environment. I then had to do the reverse and configure the route table for the on-premises VPC and add the CIDR range for the AWS VPC. Once this was completed, there was network connectivity between both environmen.ts 

I tested that connection by connecting to the AWS EC2-A server and pinging the IP address of the on-prem app server. I received a ping response which indicated we had network connectivity. However, I still had to integrate DNS though.

To integrate DNS, I utilized Route53 and configured inbound endpoints which allowed the on-premises environment to resolve DNS records that are stored on the DNS infrastructure in the AWS environment. I copied down the IP addresses of the inbound endpoints that were created in AWS. These IP addresses would be necessary in the following stages. 

*Route53 inbound endpoints are elastic network interfaces which will run in AWS and can be used by the on-premises environment.*

I then had to do some configuration in the on-premise environment. I connected to the DNS A server and edited a configuration file that specifies the IP addresses that will have queries forwarded to them. It was here where I added the IP addresses of the AWS inbound endpoints I had previously created. I executed the previous steps for DNS B server.

To see if I configured everything correctly, I visited the domain at web-aws-animals4life.org. I was able to get a response back that confirms the two IP addresses are associated with our AWS inbound endpoints. I proceeded to go to Route53 hosted zones and observed I had an A record of the web.aws.animals4life.org domain which points to the 2 EC2 instances inside the AWS environment. 

The next thing I had to do was configure all the on-premise application server to use the DNS servers. I accomplished this by connecting to the server and edited a configuration file for the ethernet. I added DNS1 and DNS2 to the file and mentioned the private IPâ€™s of the DNS servers. These are the same DNS servers that are configured to forward queries to AWS. After rebooting the instance, I connected to the on-prem application server and was able to get both a DNS resolution and ping response. This told me I was able to establish network connectivity between the on-prem environment and AWS. As well as configure inbound integration so the DNS servers that are running on-premise have been configured to forward queries to Route53 inbound endpoints.

The last part was to configure the outbound endpoints in Route53. I created a rule and specified the domain name and environment that the rule will forward queries for. I provided the private IP addresses of the on-premise DNS servers. I proceeded to connect to the AWS EC2 servers and ping the on-premise application server. With a response back it confirmed to me that I was able to integrate hybrid network connectivity and DNS integration between AWS and the on-premise servers. This ultimately allowed for queries to be redirected from the on-premise DNS servers to AWS.
